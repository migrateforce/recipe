Summary and Expansion

This migration recipe provides a comprehensive plan for migrating the payment processing service from its current environment to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), specifically utilizing Cloud Run for containerized applications. It is designed for execution by AI agents with human oversight, ensuring that critical aspects like data integrity, security compliance, and minimal downtime are prioritized.

Key Components of the Migration Recipe

	•	Metadata: Contains essential information about the migration, such as the name, description, owner, priority, and estimated downtime.
	•	Source Definition: Details about the current state of the service, including how to discover the source code, artifacts, interfaces, configurations, and dependencies. This ensures that the AI agent can accurately assess what needs to be migrated.
	•	Behavioral Requirements: Specifies runtime behaviors such as scaling parameters, reliability targets, and security requirements. This information is crucial for maintaining service quality post-migration.
	•	Target Environment: Defines the desired state on GCP, including services to be used, configurations, networking setup, and security policies. This guides the AI agent in setting up the new environment to meet the specified requirements.
	•	Analysis Requirements: Outlines the analyses the AI agent must perform on the codebase, security aspects, and performance metrics to identify potential issues before migration.
	•	Validation Plan: Provides a staged approach to testing, from development through to production, ensuring that the migrated service functions correctly at each stage.
	•	Observability Setup: Describes the monitoring and logging requirements to keep track of the service’s performance and health in the new environment.
	•	Rollback Strategy: Defines triggers and steps for rolling back the migration in case of significant issues, ensuring that service continuity is maintained.
	•	AI Agent Instructions: Gives specific priorities and constraints to guide the AI agent’s decision-making process, especially at critical decision points like database migration strategies.

Benefits of This Specification

	•	AI-Driven Migration: By providing detailed instructions and parameters, the AI agent can automate much of the migration process, reducing manual effort and potential for human error.
	•	Human Oversight: Although AI agents execute the migration, human oversight ensures that critical decisions are reviewed and approved, balancing efficiency with caution.
	•	Comprehensive Planning: The recipe covers all aspects of migration, from discovery to rollback, providing a clear roadmap for both AI agents and human teams.
	•	Reusability and Standardization: This specification can serve as a template for migrating other services, promoting standard practices across the organization.

Usage Instructions

	1.	Review the Migration Recipe: Ensure all the details in the recipe are accurate and complete, including source locations, dependencies, and target configurations.
	2.	Customize as Needed: Adjust any parameters specific to your organization’s policies or the particular service being migrated.
	3.	Prepare the AI Agent: Load the migration recipe into the AI migration tool, ensuring it supports the AMRS v1.0 specification.
	4.	Execute Pre-Migration Analyses: Allow the AI agent to perform the required code, security, and performance analyses to identify potential issues.
	5.	Proceed with Migration: Begin the migration process, closely monitoring the AI agent’s actions and intervening if necessary.
	6.	Validate at Each Stage: Follow the validation plan to test the service in development, staging, and production environments.
	7.	Monitor Observability Metrics: Use the specified metrics and logs to monitor the service’s performance and health post-migration.
	8.	Be Prepared for Rollback: Keep the rollback strategy ready to execute in case of any critical failures or unmet performance criteria.


This AI-First Migration Recipe Specification provides a detailed and structured approach to migrating critical services using AI automation while maintaining essential oversight. By following this recipe, organizations can achieve efficient, secure, and reliable migrations to new platforms or services.

Note: Replace placeholder URLs, paths, and other organization-specific details with actual values relevant to your environment before executing the migration.
